# GPT-Neo-X 20B Fine-tuning with BnB 4-bit Training

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the GPT-Neo-X 20B model using BnB (Bits and Bytes) 4-bit training. It showcases the integration of the GPT-Neo-X model, the PEFT library, and the Hugging Face Trainer for efficient fine-tuning.

## Installation

To run this code, please ensure that the following packages are installed:

- bitsandbytes
- transformers
- peft
- datasets


## Description

The code performs the following steps:

1. Loads the GPT-Neo-X 20B model and configures it for 4-bit training using the BnB library.
2. Applies preprocessing to the model using the PEFT library to prepare it for training.
3. Prints the number of trainable parameters in the model.
4. Loads a dataset of English quotes for fine-tuning.
5. Sets up the training using the Hugging Face Trainer, specifying the training arguments and data collator.
6. Runs the training for a specified number of steps.
7. Saves the trained model and outputs in the "outputs" directory.

Please note that this code is a simplified version for demonstration purposes and may require further adjustments for production use.
